# VNL KZ Maps
As of 10/26/21; these collections included the maps that are known to be possible in the VNL gamemode. It does exculde maps that have been proven possible but have been degloballed either due to the mapper or the Global Map Team. The maps in the collection that haven't been completed yet may not have a global filter as of the time of writing, so a completetion may not be recorded on the API.
